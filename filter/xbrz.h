| xBRZ: "Scale by rules" - high quality image upscaling filter by Zenju |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
using a modified approach of xBR:
http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2248
- new rule set preserving small image features
- highly optimized for performance
- support alpha channel
- support multithreading
- support 64-bit architectures
- support processing image slices
- support scaling up to 6xBRZ
*/

};

/*
-> map source (srcWidth * srcHeight) to target (scale * width x scale * height) image, optionally processing a half-open slice of rows [yFirst, yLast) only
-> support for source/target pitch in bytes!
-> if your emulator changes only a few image slices during each cycle (e.g. DOSBox) then there's no need to run xBRZ on the complete image:
   Just make sure you enlarge the source image slice by 2 rows on top and 2 on bottom (this is the additional range the xBRZ algorithm is using during analysis)
   Caveat: If there are multiple changed slices, make sure they do not overlap after adding these additional rows in order to avoid a memory race condition
   in the target image data if you are using multiple threads for processing each enlarged slice!

THREAD-SAFETY: - parts of the same image may be scaled by multiple threads as long as the [yFirst, yLast) ranges do not overlap!
               - there is a minor inefficiency for the first row of a slice, so avoid processing single rows only; suggestion: process 8-16 rows at least
