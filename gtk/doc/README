Snes9x for GTK+/X11 README
-------------------------

  The following contains installation instructions, known issues, and info on
  features currently missing from the GTK+ port of Snes9x.


Requirements / Build Notes:
---------------------------

  The GTK+ port of Snes9x is a separate codebase from the unix port, and uses a
  variety of multiplatform libraries for compatibility. The following
  are the required libraries for this port:

    Library                Required Version
    ------------------------------------
    GTK+                   >= 2.10 and dependencies
    libxml2                >= 2.0
    One or more of portaudio, PulseAudio, SDL, ALSA, or OSS

    GTK+ 3.10 or greater is now supported and is the default version selected.
    If you wish to build for GTK+ 2, you may pass the --with-gtk2 parameter
    to the configure script.

  And for joystick support:

    Library             Required Version
    ------------------------------------    
    SDL                 >= 2.0.1

  OpenGL support is also available. This requires the extra library:

    Library             Required Version
    ------------------------------------
    libepoxy            >= 1.5.6 recommended

  OpenGL and joystick support will automatically be enabled if configure
  can find the required libraries. You may disable them with:
  --without-joystick or --without-opengl passed to configure.

  The usual configure command as an example would be:
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

  Next, issue the "make" command:
    $ make

  An standalone executable named "snes9x-gtk" will be created. This may be
  run in place. To install the program and its data, such as .desktop
  entries, icons, and the cheat database, use:
    # make install
  as a privileged user or
    $ sudo make install
  and enter your password.

Joystick Support:
-----------------

  Snes9x will autodetect your joystick when run. If you've used any
  calibration programs beforehand, you may need to reboot your operating
  system to undo the damage they've done.
