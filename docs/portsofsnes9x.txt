These are all the known ports of Snes9X to other consoles/handhelds/etc as of
2011/04/19. They are all supported and welcomed on the official Snes9X site.

**If you know of anyone who is currently working on a port of Snes9X, please
have them go to the Snes9X forums (http://www.snes9x.com/phpbb2/) and have
them register an account there. After that, speak to Ryan and/or Jerremy so
you can be let into the devs area and the git so you can have access to the
most current code, collaborate with the other developers, etc.**

Ports and how to get them running are as follows:

*PSP Version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X Euphoria
Latest version: R5 Beta
Homepage/forum: http://www.retroemu.com/forum/
Maintainer: Zack

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* Downgrading/upgrading your firmware
* Checking if your PSP-2000 series can use Pandora's Battery
* Checking if your PSP-3000 series can use the DaveeFTW Downgrader
* Creating Pandora's Battery
* Finding the hacks, HENs, CFWs, etc and how to use/install them

1. Make sure your PSP is hackable in some way. This means:
* PSP-1000 series and certain PSP-2000 series can use Pandora Battery
* PSP-2000 series that can't use Pandora Battery, most PSP-3000 series, and PSP
Gos are hackable via other means (DaveeFTW Downgrader, etc)

2. Make sure your PSP has custom firmware or a HEN that's useable (you'll have
to upgrade/downgrade the firmware as necessary). (Hint: I personally prefer
5.50 GEN-D3 on the Pandora-able PSPs; 6.20 or 6.35 PRO-B4 or better on the
non-Pandora-able PSPs.)

3. When that’s done, be sure to put the Snes9X Euphoria folder in /PSP/GAME on
your PSP’s memory stick (PSP-1000/2000/3000 series) or internal memory
(PSP Go). Be sure to copy the ROMs into the roms folder, saves (*.srm, etc)
into the saves folder, and cheats into the cheats folder.

*Wii/Gamecube version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X GX
Latest Version: 4.2.7
Homepage/forum: http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx
Maintainer: Tantric

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* Finding the latest Homebrew Channel, Snes9X GX Channel, and/or IOS58
installers and installing them
* Finding a modchip for your GameCube and installing it

Wii: You will need the latest Homebrew Channel installed on your Wii. After
that, copy and paste the apps folder onto the root of your SD card; same goes
for the snes9xgx folder. After that, copy over any ROMs you have to the
\snes9xgx\roms folder, save files (*.srm, etc) to the \snes9xgx\saves folder,
and cheats to the \snes9xgx\cheats folder.

In addition, there appears to be a channel for Snes9X GX; you will need the
Homebrew Channel installed and you MUST be on System Menu 4.3 so you can be on
IOS58 (or use the IOS58 installer). After that, you should be able to run the
installer from the Homebrew Channel, and you'll be good to go! 

Gamecube: You might need a modchip.

*Android and iOS (Apple iPhone/iPod Touch) version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X EX
Latest Version: 1.3.22
Homepage/forum: http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex
Maintainer: Rakashazi (on the Snes9X forums)

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch) ONLY!!!: Jailbreaking your firmware

Android: It appears you can just download from the Android app-store thingy and
run it from there :) Be sure to copy over your ROMs/saves/etc though.

iOS: You’ll have to jailbreak your firmware and install the Cydia app
installer. Then you’ll have to install the BigBoss repository within Cydia and
search for Snes9X EX; you may also want to search for the sshd and all needed 
stuff for that, as it’s the only way you can put the ROMs/saves/etc onto your
iPhone/iPod Touch. After that you should be able to download and run from there
:)

*PS3 version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X PS3
Latest Version: 4.4.9
Homepage/forum: https://code.google.com/p/snes9x-ps3/ (although for some
reason, you may have to Google for the latest version)
Maintainer: Squarepusher

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* Finding a HEN/Jailbreaker/CFW/etc onto your PS3 and installing it
* (if necessary) Downgrading/Upgrading your PS3's firmware

You’ll have to install a HEN/Jailbreaker/CFW/etc on your PS3 (you might have to
upgrade or downgrade your PS3’s firmware as needed). After that, it should be
as simple as copy the emulator/ROMs over to the PS3 and it should work :)
